This plugin is a community third-party plug-in development template, in addition to the official development template provides a basic level of functionality, has the following features:

1. based on vite package project, support for hot-loading, in dev mode whether the code or i18n changes can be automatically tracked
2. soft linking instead of putting the project into the plugins directory program development, you can feel free to develop multiple projects in the same workspace at the same time, and do not worry about accidentally deleting the project code in the source
3. built-in support for the svelte framework, compared to react, vue and other virtual DOM-based solutions, svelte such compiled framework is more suitable for plug-in development of such lightweight scenarios
4. provides a github action template to automatically generate package.zip and upload to new release
5. pre-packaged siyuan.d.ts module, no need to manually replace the siyuan module under the node_module
6. Provide with api.ts and sy-dtype.d.ts


## Template usage

1. Use Template

2. Clone to local

3. Create development soft links

    - Create the dev directory
    - Run the ``scripts/make_dev_link.py`` script, passing in the absolute path to the plugins directory, e.g.

        ```powershell
        >> sudo python . \scripts\make_dev_link.py H:\temporary folder\SiYuanDevSpace\data\plugins
        Folder already exists, exit
        ```

        - You may need sudo to run it, I installed sudo myself on windows via scoop and can run it directly that way, normal windows users can first open the command line as administrator and then run it.
    - If you haven't installed python in your environment, you can also manually make a soft link, reference to [mklink](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink)
        - Notice: make sure that the name of soft link is same as the name in your plugin.json
    - As the generated softlink is the same as the plugin name, do not put the project directory under plugins (this is contrary to the official template)

4. development

    - When pnpm dev mode is enabled, the code and i18n README plugin.json are automatically tracked and the compiled results are placed in the dev directory
    - The new version of SiYuan already allows soft links, so there is no need to put the project under plugin.

5. manual release (You can use github action instead)

    - pnpm build, automatically generates package.zip


## Github action

The github action is included and can be automatically packaged and published:

1. set the project `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/settings/actions` page down to **Workflow Permissions** and open the configuration

    ! [](asset/action.png)

2. when you need to release a version, push a tag in the format `v*` and github will automatically release (including package.zip)

3. use conservative pre-release by default, if you don't think this is necessary, change the settings in release.yml to

    ```yaml
    - name: Release
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with.
            allowUpdates: true
            artifactErrorsFailBuild: true
            artifacts: 'package.zip'
            token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            prerelease: true # change this to false
    ```
